# Code of Conduct

We are strongly committed to ensuring that our community, and any online and offline spaces in which its members congregate and collaborate (at a minimum of 6 feet!), are safe, positive, inclusive, constructive, and welcoming environments.

As such, this project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org).

The [current latest version of the Contributor Covenant can be found here](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/).

Lack of familiarity with the Contributor Covenant is not an excuse for non-adherence.


## Reporting

If you are the subject of any behavior prohibited by this Code of Conduct, or observe someone who is, please [join the Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/covid-atlas/shared_invite/zt-d6j8q1lw-C4t00WbmIjoxeHgxn_GDPQ) and DM a designated team member immediately: Larry Davis, or Ryan Block.

If possible, please attempt to collect any relevant information and evidence, including links, screenshots, or other recordings of any incident.

Reports will be handled with the utmost care, confidence, and sensitivity towards the individual(s) reporting.


## Enforcement

Should incidents arise, upon adjudication those found to be in violation of this Code of Conduct may be immediately expelled from participation in the project, which also includes any events, forums, chat workspaces, code repositories, and any other place where community members collaborate.
