<!--
Hello!

This project is being replaced by Li, https://github.com/covidatlas/li, the next-generation serverless crawler for COVID-19 data.  The reasons for the switchover are documented in https://github.com/covidatlas/coronadatascraper/issues/782.

We are not _actively_ accepting PRs for this repository.

Note: Scraper code written for this project is not compatible with Li, see that project for examples.  We have some helpers to assist in migrating code, see [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ITPU0hESswmiWw88Pl1eI26oIQtMJw1YUeD8mWEPIeE/edit#).

Thanks very much!
